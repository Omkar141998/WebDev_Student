  <p class="task "> His name, sir, was Matthew Price; mine is Benjamin Hardy. We were born within a few days of each
    other; bred up in the same village; taught at the same school. I cannot remember the time when we were not close
    friends. Even as boys, we never knew what it was to quarrel. We had not a thought, we had not a possession, that was
    not in common. We would have stood by each other, fearlessly, to the death. It was such a friendship as one reads
    about sometimes in books: fast and firm as the great Tors upon our native moorlands, true as the sun in the heavens.
